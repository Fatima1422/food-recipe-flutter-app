Meal Planner Mobile Application

This mobile application project was completed as part of my university Mobile Application Development course.

Project Overview: The Meal Planner app allows users to browse different meals, view ingredients and cooking steps, apply meal filters, mark meals as favorites, and watch cooking videos through external links.

Key Features:

Meal listing with images
Meal detail view (ingredients & preparation steps)
Favorite meals functionality
Meal filters (diet preferences)
Watch video option (external link)
Smooth navigation and clean UI
Technology Stack:

Flutter
Dart
Material Design
Local dummy data
setState for state management
Data Handling: This application uses locally stored dummy data. No database or cloud backend is integrated. The project is designed as an offline prototype for academic purposes.

Note: This project is based on an open-source GitHub repository. I have personally set up, run, tested, customized the UI/text, and prepared the project for runtime changes as required for academic evaluation.
